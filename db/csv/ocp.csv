    "event_details": "With the advent of AI/ML applications driving the next technological revolution, Data Center network infrastructure that powers these AI/ML clusters takes center stage in enabling that leap forward. In this talk we will focus on how traditional ECMP based IP fabrics fall short of meeting the requirements for such applications and how  Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric built using SONiC enables optimal usage of the available network bandwidth. We will share how we developed, deployed and analyzed both technologies and will share how they compare.",

    "event_details": "SONiC has become the NOS of choice for cloud networks, leveraging openness and data center scale providing a state-of-the-art microservices architecture suitable for network packet brokering. Typical Network Packet Brokers are appliance-based, and proprietary in nature, making them expensive and inflexible. With SONiC, Aviz has developed the industryâ€™s first Open Packet Broker to help customers perform inline Security monitoring without compromising Network Availability. The Open Packet Broker solution harnesses the power of the NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet ASIC providing Security team to select and distribute traffic across multiple inline security tools. SONiC is the perfect platform for a standardized packet broker solution that can provide a true Software Defined TAP and Software Defined Aggregation on hardware accelerated, highly programmable switch platforms like Spectrum Ethernet.
